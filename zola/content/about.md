Hello! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Alex and I am a graduate student in Computer Science, currently located in Barcelona doing an exchange semester.

Over the two years I have been delving into theoretical computer science at TU Wien, especially into algorithms and computational complexity. I find computation as a concept to be quite joyful as it seems to me as if it is still not very well understood.

Before my current endeavours, I have been working as a data scientist at a Viennese startup called XUND, working on language models that extract information from medical data and in parallel pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence at JKU Linz.
