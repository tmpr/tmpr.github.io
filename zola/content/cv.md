<summary><strong>High School</strong>, BRG Hamerlingstra√üe, <i>2010 - 2018</i></summary>

I went to a public high school and picked computer science as an elective. I graduated with a GPA of 1.0 and completed my final exams with a GPA of 1.1. In addition, I was part of the student's council and partook in state-wide foreign language competitions, placing 3rd in the Spanish competition and 4th place in the English-Spanish "switch"-competition.

## Professional Experience

<details>

<summary><strong>Student Research Assistant</strong>, TU Wien, <i>October 2024 - February 2025</i></summary>

As a part-time job at the <a href="https://www.ac.tuwien.ac.at/">Algorithms and Complexity Group</a> of TU Wien, I was trying find out whether an multidimensional extension of so called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_peaked_preferences">single peakedeness</a> is a robust model. I did so by running a variety of combinatorial solvers on natural preference data from a publicly available data source called <a href="https://preflib.github.io/PrefLib-Jekyll/">preflib</a>. In doing this, I gathered experience with such aformentioned solvers, C++ and high performance computing.

<summary><strong>Junior Data Scientist</strong><i>, XUND
August 2021 - August 2023</i> </br> </summary>

At <a href="https://xund.ai">XUND</a>, a Viennese healthtech startup, I developed medium sized language models which extracted structured information from publicly available literature about medicine. There, I was able to learn many things about how to build and deploy AI and collaborate with others to develop innovative new kinds of software.

<summary><strong>Student Assistant</strong>, JKU Linz, <i>October 2020 - June 2021</i> </br></summary>

I was a tutor for <a href="https://studienhandbuch.jku.at/104258?lang=en">UE Algorithms and Data Structures 1</a>, grading homework and proposing small changes to the assignments to improve their quality.

<summary><strong>Nonmilitary Service</strong> Linz,
<i>October 2018 - July 2019</i></summary>

As Austria still has a mandatory military service for men, I completed my alternative/non-military service in an elderly care home, preparing breakfast and being responsible for the lunch logistics.
