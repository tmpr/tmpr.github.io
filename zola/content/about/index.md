Hello! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Alex and I am a graduate student in computer science, currently located in Barcelona for an exchange semester.

## Professional

Over the past two years, I have been delving into theoretical computer science at TU Wien, especially into algorithms and computational complexity. I find computation as a concept to be quite alluring, as it seems to me as if it is still not very well understood.

Before my current endeavors, I have been working as a data scientist at a Viennese startup called XUND, working on language models that extract information from medical data. In parallel, I was pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence at JKU Linz.

## Personal

Overall, simple things, like discovering new music or coffee, are what appeal to me in my spare time. Besides that, I go to the gym, read a book from time to time, and try to keep in touch with friends and family. To finish, I leave you with some of my favorite albums.
